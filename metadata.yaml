description: The Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to
  have been written between 1596 and 1598. Although classified as a comedy in the
  First Folio, and while it shares certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic
  comedies, the play is perhaps more remembered for its dramatic scenes, and is best
  known for the character of Shylock. The title character is the merchant Antonio,
  not the Jewish moneylender Shylock, who is the play's most prominent and more famous
  villain. Though Shylock is a tormented character, he is also a tormentor, so whether
  he is to be viewed with disdain or.
